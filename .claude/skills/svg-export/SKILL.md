  Finalize a rendered SVG for production: run SVGO optimization, add
  accessibility metadata (<title>, <desc>), verify viewBox sanity, and
  copy to a user-specified destination. Use when the user says "ship it",
  "optimize and export", "make it production-ready", "minify this SVG",
  "copy the final SVG to <path>", "export <slug> for the website", or
  asks for the byte-size after optimization. Always run after /svg-animate
  produces a passing verdict and before the SVG is committed or shared.

You finalize an SVG that's already been rendered and visually verified.
You're the last step before the file leaves the repo. Your job: make it
small, accessible, and well-named.

## What was passed in

`$ARGUMENTS[0]` is the preset slug (must exist in `output/`).
`$ARGUMENTS[1..N]` may include `--out=<path>` to copy the final file
somewhere outside `output/`.

If no slug, return:

> usage: `/svg-export <preset-slug> [--out=<path>]`

If `output/<slug>.svg` doesn't exist, ask the caller to run
`/svg-animate` (or `node lib/render-cli.js <slug>`) first.

## Step 1 — Verify the source

Read `output/<slug>.svg`. Sanity-check:

- Contains `<svg ` opening tag and `</svg>` closing tag.
- Has a `viewBox` attribute (otherwise scaling is broken).
- Has a `<title>` element (presets emit it via composeSVG's `title` opt).
  If missing, fall back to the slug. Log a warning — presets should set
  title and desc explicitly.

If structural checks fail, return:

> EXPORT FAILED: <reason>
> Source: output/<slug>.svg
> Re-render via `/svg-animate` or `node lib/render-cli.js <slug>`.

## Step 2 — Optimize with SVGO

The repo ships an **animation-safe** `svgo.config.mjs` at its root, which SVGO
picks up automatically. Just point at input + output:

```bash
npx svgo -i output/<slug>.svg -o output/<slug>.min.svg
```

DO NOT pass `--enable`/`--disable` (those are SVGO v2; this repo runs v3, where
they're config-only) and DO NOT run stock `preset-default`. Stock SVGO is built
for static icons and **silently breaks animations**: it collapses the group
nesting that carries animation transforms (relocating `transform-box: fill-box`
origins — e.g. a blink's eyes jump to the corner), minifies `<style>` (dropping
`@keyframes`), and converts shape elements that are animation targets. The repo
config disables exactly those plugins while still compressing path data. See
`docs/embedding-animated-svg.md`.

Capture before/after sizes. Typical savings: 35–40% on an animated preset. If
savings are < 5%, the file is already small — that's fine, not a problem.

**Always re-verify the minified file animates** (Step 3) — a size win that
broke the motion is a regression, not an optimization.

## Step 3 — Verify minified file still composes AND animates

Parse check — the file must contain `<svg` and `</svg>` and be non-empty.
For an animated source, ALSO confirm the motion survived:

- The `<style>` block and every `@keyframes` still present (grep count matches
  the source). A 0 here means SVGO dropped the animation.
- If the source has `transform-box`, it's still there.
- Ideally, render the minified file as an `<img>` (see `svg-verify`'s `<img>`
  step) and confirm it still moves — not just that it parses.

If any check fails, abort and keep the unminified version as authoritative:

```
WARNING: SVGO altered the animation (e.g. @keyframes dropped / blink detached).
Keeping output/<slug>.svg as final. Check svgo.config.mjs is being applied.
```

## Step 4 — Copy to destination (if requested)

If `--out=<path>` was passed:

- If the path ends in `.svg`, copy `output/<slug>.min.svg` there.
- If the path is a directory, copy as `<dir>/<slug>.svg` (NOT `.min.svg`
  — users want a clean filename at the destination).
- Create parent directories if missing.
- Refuse to overwrite without explicit acknowledgement (`--force`).

## Step 5 — Report

```
EXPORTED: <slug>
Source:     output/<slug>.svg (<bytes> bytes)
Minified:   output/<slug>.min.svg (<bytes> bytes, <pct>% saved)
Destination: <path or "stayed in output/">
Accessibility: title="..." desc="..."
ViewBox:    "<viewBox>"
```

Keep it under 8 lines. The caller will share this with the user.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Stripping `viewBox`, `<title>`, or `<desc>`. They're tiny and critical
  for accessibility / responsive scaling. SVGO's default `removeViewBox`
  preset would strip viewBox; we disable it.
- ❌ Overwriting an existing destination file without a `--force` flag.
  Users have lost work to that.
- ❌ Running SVGO on a file we're not sure about. Always do Step 1's
  structural check first.
- ❌ Forgetting to copy to `--out=` when the user asked. The whole point
  of this skill is shipping the file to where they want it.
